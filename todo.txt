[x] Chunks
[x] Texture Atlas
[x] Separate game object per chunk for transparent voxels
[x] Add/Remove voxels
[x] Set multiple voxels in sphere shape
[x] WorldGen.GetUVsForTile: Pregenerate UVs once for all tiles
[x] Torch
    [ ] Torch base object not affected by torch light
    [ ] Integrate torches into chunk infrastructure
[x] Simple cave generator based on cellular automata

[ ] Custom models as part of voxel infrastructure (e.g. stairs, doors etc.)
    [ ] One mesh for all?
    [ ] One mesh for all same models so they can share a texture?
    [ ] How about special objects such as torches that are not simple models?

[ ] Blob
    [x] Randomly moving around voxel world
    [ ] Correct jumping on levels above or below blob -> add rigidbody & jump via impulse

[x] Place/Remove Block player is looking at

[ ] Day/Night System
    [ ] Sun rise/set
    [ ] Moon
    [ ] Control via scene skybox / hue
    [ ] Control via skybox light intensity

[ ] Water simulation

[ ] Voxel Property: Collideable (e.g. Water) -> better word than collideable?

    Issues / Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Holes in voxel world when destroying voxels on chunk borders

[ ] Lighting is different between chunks / no smooth lighting transition between chunks

[ ] Center texel correction causes seams between voxels / half-pixels at the border of voxels

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Refactoring
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Multithreaded chunk building

[ ] Refactor ChunkBuilder

[ ] Get VoxelInfo from config file (solid, tileXY etc.)

    Optimization

[ ] Chunk occlusion culling?
    https://tomcc.github.io/2014/08/31/visibility-1.html

[ ] Optimize mesh generation to merge adjoining voxel faces with same Texture
    -> Does that work with texture atlas UVs?

[x] Player obj w/ FPS Camera Controller
