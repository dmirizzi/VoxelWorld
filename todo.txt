[x] Chunks
[x] Texture Atlas
[x] Separate game object per chunk for transparent voxels
[x] Add/Remove voxels
[x] Set multiple voxels in sphere shape
[x] WorldGen.GetUVsForTile: Pregenerate UVs once for all tiles
[x] Torch
    [ ] Torch base object not affected by torch light
    [ ] Integrate torches into chunk infrastructure

[ ] Chunk occlusion culling?
    https://tomcc.github.io/2014/08/31/visibility-1.html

[ ] Optimize mesh generation to merge adjoining voxel faces with same Texture
    -> Does that work with texture atlas UVs?

[ ] Lighting is different between chunks / no smooth lighting transition between chunks

[ ] Blob
    [x] Randomly moving around voxel world
    [ ] Correct jumping on levels above or below blob -> add rigidbody & jump via impulse

[x] Player obj w/ FPS Camera Controller

[ ] Cave generator

[ ] Day/Night System
    [ ] Sun rise/set
    [ ] Moon
    [ ] Control via scene skybox / hue
    [ ] Control via skybox light intensity

[ ] Water simulation
